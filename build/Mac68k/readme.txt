                         A text adventure, by Davide Bucci


Introduction  Today is April 19, 1907. You, Emilia Vittorini, arrived yesterday
in Varenna, on the shore of the beautiful Lake Como. You are hosted at the
magnificent Villa Briccorosso; Princess Lucilla Briccorosso is preparing for
the Silk Road Race, a 10,000km rally raid between Cairo in Egypt and Peking in
China, to be done by car.

You represent ITA, founded by your father, the company that built the car the
Princess just bought to use during the rally. The car is supposed to be
delivered today. Your role will be to assist the delivery and make sure
everything is perfectly functional.

Not everything will work following your plans...

The game is available for many other 8-bit and 16-bit platforms.

A text adventure is a game where all the interaction takes places with text and
you instruct your alter ego by typing command at a prompt. The rest is done by
your fantasy!

Here are some important commands:

"look": describe again the location where the player is present.
"examine object": describe the specified object.

"north" or "n" or "go to north": moves to the north, if possible. Other
directions are "s", "e", "w", "up", "down". At a certain moment of the game,
you will have to use other commands, but instructions will be given at the due
moment.

The command "bye" allows to exit from the game and "restart" well... restarts
it.

You can "take" objects that you notice and you can have a list of carried
objects with "inventory".

The following abbreviations are available:

"l" for "look"
"x" or "ex" for "examine"
"i" or "inve" or "inven" for "inventory"

The game is divided in four parts. When you complete one of them, you will get
a code that allows to immediately jump to the beginning of the next part. Those
passwords are important, write them down!

You can also "save" and "load" your progress on disk on most computers that can
load the game from disks.
