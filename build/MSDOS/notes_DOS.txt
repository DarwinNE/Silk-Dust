ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR THE MSDOS VERSION OF SILK DUST

    Davide Bucci

This version contains all the game in a single file that is called either
SILK.EXE or SILKN.EXE. The SILKN.EXE version does not contain the splash screen
and any ANSI command (colours for the text, etc). It should run on some pretty
barebone systems.

If you want ANSI coloured text, make sure the following line is contained in
your CONFIG.SYS file:

DEVICE=DOS\ANSI.SYS
