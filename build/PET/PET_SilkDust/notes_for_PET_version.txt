                                    SILK DUST

                         A text adventure, by Davide Bucci

This version of the game should run on a Commodore PET computer with at least 
32KB of RAM and a 40 or 80 column display. PET40 and PET80 in the file names 
refer to this. For your convenience, the game is distributed in both six .prg
files that you can load immediately in your emulator (drag and drop in Vice,
for instance), or with two disk images that should work for a 2032 disk drive.

PET 3032: Type POKE 59468,14 before running the game to switch to the lower case
font. Load the 40 column version of the game.

PET 4032: Load the 40 column version of the game.

PET 8032, 8096, 8296: Load the 80 column version of the game.

PET 2001, 3008, 3016, 4016: Unsupported.
