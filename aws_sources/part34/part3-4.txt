You spent some weeks working closely with Briccorosso to prepare the Silk Road rally. It's now July 23, 1907. Four days ago, you have boarded a steam ferry called Dynamene to get to Alexandria, in Egypt. It contains the car and all the goods will be useful for the expedition. For the moment, it has been a nice cruise; you spent a lot of time with Briccorosso studying maps and routes between Egypt and India. It's the last evening you will spend onboard: tomorrow morning you are supposed to berth at Alexandria.^M^MTo move on the Dynamene, use fore (f), aft (a), port (p) and starboard (s).

Certainly not here!

You don't want to disturb him. He's occupied.
122
You won't need violence to complete this part of the game.
231
You may try, but it will probably not work.
400
No. You aren't tired now.
401
No need to do that now.
402
Use 'bye' if you want to stop playing.
403
Oh, no, we are not going to stay here all day!
407
This is a text adventure game. Read descriptions carefully and type commands such as 'examine bed'. Type "north", "south", ... to move in the desired direction.. Abbreviations are possible "x" for "examine", "l" to "look" (i.e. describe your current location again), "i" for "inventory," "n" for "north" and so on. To quit the game, type "bye". To restart it, type "restart".
408
Please, type a more specific action...
504
Please feel free to continue, if you wish to... I've become impervious to swearing and profanity a long time ago.
505
No, you don't feel the need.

You'll examine yourself much better with a mirror.

Khalil Maalouf is the captain and is an athletic man, about 40 years old. He is respected by the crew.
601
He must be 24 or 25 years old, is slightly taller than you, with brown hair and a wispy beard. He has a gentle stare in his brown eyes. You like him a lot.
;...Note: If people are having problems guessing that ALbert needs kissing, then perhaps somethong like:-
;... He must be 24 or 25 years old, is slightly taller than you, with brown hair and a wispy beard. He has a gentle stare in his brown eyes. You are quite attracted to him.
602
You haven't yet had the opportunity to talk to Albert alone and nobody is around. You look at him seriously and you say to him, coldly:^M- Mr. Pinel, I received your message while I was in Turin. I would like to inform you that I am perfectly able to decide by myself when to take part to an adventure or not.^M^MAlbert looks stunned and mortified.^M^M- Euh, I meant... I wanted to... I'm sorry, I did not want to...^M^MThen you smiles and you kiss him intensely. Albert looks even more stunned, yet full of joy.^M^M- Oh, Emilia, I love you, I love you since the first moment I saw you in the rose garden, I love you...^M^M- I know...^M^MYou both stay embraced kissing for a while, but then you stop, as you don't want to be seen. You both continue to stare into each other's eyes in the amber light of one of the most beautiful sunsets the Mediterranean sea can offer to its lucky travellers.

Princess Lucilla Briccorosso is 35 years old and is an energetic woman, born into one of the oldest Italian families. She has short blonde hair, is relatively thin and not very tall, but her body is athletic and her green eyes shine with a light of determination.
604
Youssef is the cook of the Dynamene. He has the physique du rôle you would expect from a cook: large shoulders and belly.
605
- Youssef, what are you preparing?^M- Oh, hello Madam! Sarah caught some nice sea breams this afternoon and I am preparing them with a side dish of escarole endive stewed Neapolitan style.^M^MThe smell is delicious!
; - Youssef, what are you preparing?^M- Oh, hello Madam! Sarah caught some nice sea bream this afternoon and I am preparing them with a side dish of escarole endive stewed Neapolitan style.^M^MThe smell is delicious!

; A stare from the cook makes you understand it's better not explore the pantry while he can see you.
607
Vittorio is the youngest member of the crew and is nicknamed Toyo. He works swiftly and does not speak very much.
608
Sarah is tall, about 30 years old, wearing a working suit. She keeps her red hair tied up and is greasing the steam engine.
609
No, she's working.
610
It's a large triple-action steam engine. Steam comes from the steam generator next to the coal bunker.
611
- We are going to berth tomorrow morning in Alexandria, captain?^M- Yes, the sea will be calm tonight and I expect we will be there at around 8 in the morning.
612
You hear Youssef calling: dinner is served! You meet with the crew, the captain, princess Briccorosso and Albert in the central room.^M^MThe sea breams prepared by Youssef are excellent and so is the stewed escarole endive accompanying them. It's the last evening you spend onboard and the crew members have been your friends and family for the last four days. After having eaten, the captain returns to his duties and takes the place of Neda, while she eats at her turn.^M^MYou spend the rest of the evening listening to Youssef, a great storyteller who had many adventures sailing the seven seas. You tried to act casually, but you intercept Albert's stare once or twice.^M^MAt the end of the evening, everybody not on duty goes to rest. You go in your cabin, too, but you can't sleep, thinking to Albert.^M

613
While you open the door, you hear a loud thump. You run on the main deck: a smaller boat is close to the ferry and shot a a grappling hook that got caught in the railing. The small boat sports a 5cm cannon pointed towards the Dynamene. Captain Maalouf comes, cursing.^M^M- I've heard bands of marauders rob small commercial ferries. Unfortunately, a shot from that 5 cm cannon would probably get through us from side to side.^M^MYou hear a order shout from the boat:^M^M- Stop engines or we sink you.^M^MCaptain Maalouf can't but follow the order and in a few minutes four heavily armed individuals mount onboard.^M^M- Captain remains with us. Everybody else in the cabins or we shoot!^MWhile an unceremonious pirate escorts you to your cabin, you hear the chief of the pirates asking to captain Maalouf:^M^M- Where is the princess?^M^MAh, they know about Briccorosso!

614
You see the pirates' ship not too far below. There is a rope ladder on the bulwark, close to the porthole.
615
No, the door is blocked from outside and those criminals have left someone on lookout.
616
You open the porthole, noticing you can almost reach the ladder.
617
You keep your personal belongings there. It's closed, now.
618
You open your closet, to see if you can find something useful inside.
619
You see your luggage.
620
You search your luggage for something useful. No arms there, but you see an umbrella.
621
You are currently heading towards Egypt, but you are Piemontese, after all. Not really menacing, but maybe it can cause some harm?
622
Don't you think you have talked enough with him?
623
Yay! With the umbrella you pull the rope ladder towards you. You can descend to the pirates' ship, as nobody remained there.
624
Examined in detail, the cannon does not seem so impressive. It is probably 50 years old and has to be ignited with a linstock through its touch hole.
625
You would like to talk a lot with him, but not now.
626
No, somebody is there!
627
You examine the loading hatch to see if there is a way to get inside, you notice a manhole close to it.
628
There is a service ladder, below.
629
It's the main loading hatch. Through it, the holds have been loaded using the crane.
630
It looks promising.
631
The door leading to the crew's quarters is shut.
632
Among the tools, you find a hammer and some large nails.
633
You insert one of the nails in the touch hole. It is the right size to completely block it. Covered by the noise of the sea, you hit it with the hammer and you break it inside. This cannon will not be usable very soon!
; You insert one of the nails in the touch hole. It is the right size to completely block it. Covered by the noise of the sea, you hit it with the hammer and you break it off inside. This cannon will not be usable any time soon!
634
Good idea, but better unload the cannon first.
635
Indeed, but how?
636
You push and pull a little the cannon, it can move to absorb the recoil. After a while, you realize that you can lower the muzzle and the ball rolls on the deck and falls in the sea, followed by the wadding and a little bit of gunpowder that remains on the deck.^MThat's great, but not enough! The pirates would certainly reload it in a matter of minutes.

You search among the canisters and you find some wax paper supposed to be used to close the jars of paraffin.
638

; You pour some gunpowder in the padlock. You hope the explosion will blow it apart, allowing the door to open.
640

650
That's an... explosive idea!
651
You insert the head of one match in the padlock full of gunpowder. With a certain apprehension, you light a second match and you ignite the first one. Then you run in the starboard hold, hiding yourself behind the car. You hear a loud BANG! When you return, the padlock is open!

; The explosion may attract the criminals. You must definitely do something to neutralize their cannon first.
657
You see the cylinder, the shackle and the body, torn apart.
658
Solid!
659
What you are you thinking? You should go in the crew's quarters immediately. Someone is coming from the dining room !
660
This place, as everywhere below deck, is lit by small flat-wick paraffin lamps equipped with their characteristic glass chimney.
661
No!
662
No need to hurry!
663
No, you don't want that someone else see you kissing. You will create a situation later.
; No, you don't want someone else to see you kissing. That would create a situation later.
664
You see a metallic table solidly secured to the ground, with wooden chairs next to it.
665
No, leave it alone.
666
You see the waves of the Mediterranean sea, tinted by the delicate light of sunset.
667
- Emilia, I can't wait to arrive in Egypt. We will have plenty of work to do!
668
You have worked on those maps for weeks, now! You almost know them by heart.
669
Slightly younger than the captain, Neda is a small woman with black hair and black eyes.
670
Roy is the oldest member of the crew, he must be about 60 and has candid hair and beard.
; Note: I've never heard of `candid hair...` 
671
A solid wooden bed, secured to the floor.
672
You think it is white oak wood.
673
You are not going to get into the captain's cabin without his permission!
674
The air smells of iodine and salt, with a faint fishy undertone. You breathe it in voluptuously.
675
He must be 24 or 25 years old, is slightly taller than you, with brown hair and a wispy beard. You think you love him...
676
It's a large segmented cover made by several wooden hatch-end beams and covered by a tarp. You can not remove them.
677
You saw this crane lift the ITA 150 and load it delicately in the holds of the Dynamene four days ago.
678
Nothing useful!
679
You may sit there and read a book, but not now.
680
Books about navigation and marine literature. You see Herman Melville's Moby Dick!
681
