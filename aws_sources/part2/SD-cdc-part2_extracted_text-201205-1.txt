You know your father's office well. His wooden desk is full of blueprints and a large book full of calculations. He is probably thinking to a new engine or something similar.

You arrived in Turin on Friday evening, informed your father, then spent the weekend reading. Now it's Tuesday April 23, 1907. You arrived at the ITA factory this morning to organise details of the delivery of spare parts to Princess Briccorosso. When you left her, she instructed Albert to write a message which should have arrived at the factory by now. You should find your father and discuss it.

MESSAGGI
61
Certainly not here!
66
You don't want to disturb him. He's occupied.
122
You won't need violence to complete this part of the game.
200
Your father smiles:^M^M- My dear Emilia, you made quite an impression to Princess Briccorosso. She wrote a letter to request that an agent from ITA to joins the rally. And she insisted it sould be you.^M^MYou can't believe it! You almost scream with joy: that will be a real adventure! And that Albert... uhm... he is a talented mechanic.^M^M- You will have to drive the car and write articles for the press, to be sent by telegraph during the rally. Coming to spares, here is a letter. Go see your uncle, he will organise the delivery.^M^MYou smile widely while you take it and put it in your pocket.
201
You open the letter. There is a list of the spares needed for the car. Albert discovered the rear axle had been tampered with, too. Better give that to your uncle. There is another message, addressed to you.
202
While you are opening the door of your uncle's office, Roberta, your uncle's secretary says:^M^M- Madam, Mister Tullio is occupied in a meeting, please come to see him at another moment.
203
She is young and looks to be very serious and committed to her work.
204
- Roberta, I hear voices from my uncle's office; who is meeting him?^M- A journalist, a certain Rizzitelli, from La voce del mattino, a newspaper in Milan. I don't know much apart from that he has been in discussion with your uncle for at least one hour.
205
Her name is Giovanna, but many call her Nanna. She is the young chief mechanic here and she is good at it. Giovanna has come especially from Rome to work at ITA, here in Turin. Everybody appreciates her, her energy and her accent. She is tiny, with long brown hair she keeps together with a red foulard, wearing makeup and bright orange overalls. She is currently assembling a set of five steam engines.
206
You summarise what your father said to you and Nanna smiles broadly:^M^M- Emilia, it looks like I'll have a lot of work to do to repair the car when you get back from the rally. Do try to bring it back in one piece!^M^MShe then becomes serious:^M^M- By the way, if I find who sabotaged the best 150 we built, I will make them deeply regret it.^M^MAnd you think she really means it, given the way she menacingly handles the 26mm spanner she has in her hand!
207
She looks busy. Maybe later.
208
It's a list of spare parts.
209
^MVarenna, April 25, 1907^M^MDear Miss Emilia,^M  I just learned that Princess Briccorosso asked you to take part in the rally. My heart is full of joy, as I would be honoured to go on this adventure with a driver as gifted as you. However, my conscience tells me to warn you that it may be dangerous and my life would become meaningless if something happened to you. Please remain assured that whatever your decision, I would be very happy at prospect of meeting you again.^M^MYours truly,^M  Albert Pinel^M^MIt's quite awkward: you are able to take care of yourself, but you blush nonetheless with a certain pleasure reading the message: that young man seems interested to you.
210
If you recall well, this voicepipe is connected to your uncle's office.
211
You open the cover of the voicepipe and push the button. This sends compressed air that makes ring a little bell in your uncle's office. He answers:^M^M- Hello.^M- I'm Emilia. Do you think you can come? I need to speak to you.^M- Oh, yes, I'll come immediately.^M^MAfter a couple of minutes, you see your uncle arriving in the hall.
212
Tullio is your uncle. He is about 45 years old and he is the younger brother of your father. He sports a brown beard and is always dressed in a formal way, but without ostentation. He is a great artist in his field.
213
You don't need to call your uncle now. Maybe later.
214
No, you want to discuss it with your uncle.
215
- Emilia, thanks for having called me! That young journalist was so insistant. He wanted to know everything about the model 150 we sent to Varenna and how Briccorosso is preparing for the rally.
216
You already discussed with your uncle. He is probably waiting for the journalist to go away.
217
You recognise the familiar oily smell of cutting fluid.
218
He's a giant, but with his large hands he crafts delicate metal sculptures.
219
He is using one of the noisy power hammers.
220
No, you know that Anteo does not like to be interrupted at all while he is working.
221
It's too noisy here to use the voicepipe.
222
You look at those beautiful new cars: a model 100 and a model 50A.
223
- Anteo, sorry to bother you, it seems to me that there is a dent in the bonnet of the model 100 parked in the courtyard. Is that normal?^M^M- WHAT THE...? MARCELLINOOOOO!!!^M^M The boy runs away scared and, with a grunt, Anteo says:^M^M- I'm going to check.^M^MAnteo leaves and stops the hammer. Ahhh, silence!
224
He is trying to remove the dent with his bare hands and a small wooden mallet! And with a certain success, from what you can judge. This man is impressive.
225
You give the letter with the list of spare parts to your uncle.^M^M- Uhm, Emilia, I will arrange everything. Do you suspect someone? I contacted the chief of the transport company, he is sad about what happened and said they discovered someone broke into their warehouse in Milan the night before the delivery. Their insurance will take care of everything.
226
- M'am are you Emilia Vittorini?^M^M- Yes, I am^M^M- Nice to know you, my name is Riziero Rizzitelli and I work for the Voce del mattino newspaper.^M^MThe young man starts to ask you many questions. Fortunately, you gained experience handling insistant questioners three years ago, when you came back from the mission to Egypt. You are able to extract yourself from the conversation, politely yet firmly. At the end, Rizzitelli gives you the calling card of his boss. He then asks if you think your uncle will return soon and leaves after your negative answer.
227
- It says: Altiero di Risso, La voce del mattino, Director, with an address in Milan.
228
He looks young and overly enthusiastic about his work.
229
It is a short wheel base rolling chassis, ready to be equipped with a model 50A body by coachbuilders.
230
The rolling chassis is not there anymore, the finished cars are beautiful! Wait a second: is that a dent on the side of the bonnet of the 100? Is it the result of the crash you heard?
231
You may try, but it will probably not work.
232
While you are about to speak, you understand it is better not to disturb him. Anteo yells at the workshop assistant to get the rolling chassis there. Was that the sound of a crash you just heard? Anteo rises an eyebrow. After a while, Marcellino pushes a rolling chassis there, whistling.
233
He is young and quite lazy, everybody calls him "b√≤cia," in Piedmontese. He is an orphan and you know Anteo insisted on hiring him to save him from poverty.
234
Your father is a middle-aged man, relatively tall and with bright eyes. Thirteen years ago with his brother he founded a steam car company, called ITA, i.e. Industria Torinese Automobili. He is a mechanical genius and a cultivated man.
235
- Marcellino, how are you?^M^M- Fine, Madam!
236
You try to call your uncle, but he does not hear you! You notice a button nearby.
237
You push the button, but nothing happens. You notice an airline: this thing works with compressed air and there is no pressure just now.
238
You ask to Giovanna about the compressed air:^M^M- Oh, yes, I am going to need it, too! Go to the courtyard, you'll find the compressor next to the steam engine, pull the lever on it and it will work. Here is the key for the barn's door.^M^MShe hands you a large rusted key.
239
You pull the lever, as instructed by Giovanna, but you immediately hear a burbling sound that you don't like. You switch it off.
240
It's a simple compressor system, the lever controls a clutch that engages on the main lineshaft moved by the steam engine. There is a valve on the bottom of the compressor.
241
You open the valve for a while. Some rusty water flows out for a while. That compressor truly needed that. You close the valve.
242
When you pull the lever, the sound of the compressor is much more reassuring. You see a needle indicating the pressure, slowly rising. That will do!
243
The door is locked.
244
You push the button and you listen your uncle's voice from the voicepipe.
245
It's funny that a key so large opens a door so small!
246
It's a large door in wrought iron soberly decorated, with large glass windows.
247
You see a chimney. It must contain the main steam engine of the factory.
248
It's the barn's door.
249
It's a small, unassuming button, close to the voicepipe.
250
They work hard!
251
You don't want to disturb them.
252
They soon will be shiny new cars.
253
You see the bright sunlight getting through the windows refracted through volatile dust specks.
254
One of those trip hammers is being used by Anteo and is very noisy.
255
Those two trip hammers are not being used, now.
256
Lineshafts hung from the roof distribute power in the factory and are moved by a large steam engine. When you were a kid, you wondered how the belts never walked off the pulleys. Your father once showed you that the driving pulleys are crowned and the belt self-centres on it.
257
No. You don't need to look at blueprints, yet.
258
This is a well equipped factory!
259
Roberta sees you and says:^M^M- Madam, we just received this telegram for you.^M^MShe hands it to you.
260
It says: "DEAR EMILIA STOP I'M AT SACRA SAN MICHELE STOP COME TO SEE ME IF YOU CAN. FATHER MILIERI." Oh, yes, Father Antonio Milieri was a Franciscan missionary in Luxor. You knew him during your stay in Egypt, he helped you a lot during the archeological searches. The Sacra, or the Saint Michael's Abbey is not far from Turin. You may go there today if you find a car... It won't be difficult here!
261
You go to the engine hall and you ask Giovanna for permission to test-drive one of the finished cars. She proposes you take the model 50A, in need of testing before being shipped. She agrees with you that a trip to the Saint Michael Abbey will be perfect for that. The trip there takes one hour and the car will only require minor adjustments to the brakes.^M
262
Father Milieri smiles broadly when he sees you: it's the first time you have met since you worked in Egypt three years ago. You are happy to see him too. He's a nice man.^M^M- Emilia, I'm so happy that God allowed me to meet you again!^M^MYou have a friendly chat for a few minutes. Father Milieri is a Franciscan, but loves the Abbey and his friends the Rosminians are happy to have him there when he comes back from Egypt. Then Father Milieri tells you that since last year the situation has worsened in Egypt. Some nations and empires have sent many spies toward the Suez channels, to survey their interests. Many worrying things are taking place in Egypt now. Then, Father Milieri says he has to go back to his spiritual exercises.^M^M- My dear Emilia: if you go in Egypt, please be careful!
263
Father Milieri is a tall man, about 65 years old, with white hair and a beard. He has lived for over 20 years in Luxor, in Egypt and you met him there during your mission in 1904.
264
The 50A is derived from the model 50, it's light and sporty. You like this car.
265
Those are corpses of former monks, mummified, holding a cross. Very impressive: "Remember that you have to die." 
266
It's the mountainside. On the top of it there is the church of the abbey.
267
It is stunningly decorated with astrological signs and figures, finely carved in marble. Capitals represent allegorical scenes full of the Middle Age symbolism.
268
When you try to enter the Abbey, the handyman shouts at you: you don't understand a word, but he clearly does not want you to go inside.
269
You try speaking with the handyman, understanding from his patois his name is Salvatore and not much more. He does not seem very smart, by the way...
270
He wears a habit, but he has no tonsure, probably he is not a monk. He must be an orphan raised in the abbey, to help friars with heavy work. He is ploughing a small garden, close to the entrance. He speaks patois, he probably comes from the high valley.
271
Salvatore pauses his work and notices the car: he screams with joy and runs to have a closer look to it.
272
He repeats a word: "m√†china", "m√†china". He seems really excited by the ITA 50A.
273
You make him understand that you can take him for a drive. He immediately jumps onboard. You get into the driver's seat and drive towards the nearby Colle Braida, towards Giaveno then head back towards the Avigliana lakes and to the Sacra again. In the hands of a pilot like you, it's a pretty exciting ride on those twisty roads. Salvatore is delighted! At the end he smiles to you, he will let you enter the abbey.
274
They are praying. You dont want to disturb them.
275
You have a clear view of the beautiful Avigliana castle and the lakes beside it. You also see Turin and Superga on the hill behind the city.
276
The stairs are made of stone and climb towards the entrance of the abbey.
277
It seems solid, but it is open now.
278
He does not look interested.
279
At this hour, a ray of light entering from the portal illuminates directly the skeletons. Brr!
280
It seems local marble.
281
It's a nice place.
282
You see a magnificent view of the Graian and Cottian Alps on the two sides of the valley. The Rocciamelone is the highest mountain nearby and is very easy to recognize by its shape.
283
You read somewhere they are being building a new vault: the old one threatend to collapse and was demolished.
284
There are three apses, the central one is quite large and is lit by windows and candles.
285
Romanesque, transitional Romanesque and Gothic.
286
There are strange legends on the Musin√© mountain. Some say there are witches there, other say aliens have landed there... Bunch of nonsense!
287
The drive towards Turin is uneventful. You give the 50A car back to Giovanna and tell her about the brake adjustments. You spend the next few days preparing yourself to take a ferry towards Egypt and thinking about the Silk Dust rally and what Father Milieri said about the spies.^M^MPassword for part 3: SHIBBOLETH FEMENENRIE
288
Those are wild peonies.
289
It's a fairy large and powerful steam engine. It's on and it's moving the lineshafts in all of the factory now.
290
It's a manual valve on the bottom of the air compressor tank.
291
"For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,^MWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil..."
400
No. You aren't tired now.
401
No need to do that now.
402
Use 'bye' if you want to stop playing.

Oh, no, we are not going to stay here all day!
